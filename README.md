The Songs program is designed to help users manage a personal database of songs. It 
allows you to store, modify, and retrieve detailed information about songs, including title, 
performer, album, release year, genre, and length. The program provides functionalities to 
add new songs, edit existing entries, delete songs, and display songs based on various 
criteria.
